my dotfiles
=========

A ~~simple~~ repo to backup, sync, and show off some configurations. Inspired by [Drew DeVault's method](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html) of dotfile management.

Example dotfiles for:

  - `vim`
  - `git`
  - `bash`
  - `mintty` / `git bash`
  - `gnu screen`
  - `termux`
  - `curl`
  - `starship`
  - `notepad++`
  - `windows terminal`
  - `powershell` (barely)
  - that's it!


Notepad++ Notes
============
This configuration uses Settings > Preferences > Cloud & Link to move the Notepad++ config files to .config\Notepad++.

The theme is stored as an absolute path, thus for most configurations storing the username in the config file. I've mapped my user drive to X:\ to avoid this, so anyone using my config will have to either 1) map \\\\localhost\C$\Users\{username}\ to X:\ or 2) manually select the Twilight them and FireCode NFM for the global font. At least those are my choices.
