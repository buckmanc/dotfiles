What's up, Buttercup
Welcome, traveler
How are you keeping?
How do you do?
What's shakin'?
I am honored by your presence
good day
Care to dance?
I bid thee a hearty welcome
Well aren't you a sore for sight eyes
What'll it be?
Having the usual today?
Well slap my liver and call me a pickle
Well X my Y and call me a Z
Am I getting paid for this?
Here we go again

Something new from Forcas Three?
Temba, at rest
Set phasers to stun
Welcome aboard
May this be the first of many visits.

Greetings, travellers!
Peace to you, fair wanderer
I tip my hat to you.
Lovely weather for it, eh?

I sheath my sword to you.
Fate rewards us with acquaintance!
