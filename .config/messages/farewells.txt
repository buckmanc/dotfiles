May the stars guide your path
Fair winds and following seas be with you
until our destinies intertwine again
May the spirits watch over you
Go forth, brave soul
Let your courage illuminate the darkest night
May our paths may cross once more.
May the woods whisper secrets of wisdom in your ears
Fare thee well
May the fire in your heart burn bright
May the magic within you never wane
May the heavens sing of your triumphs.
May the bards sing songs of your deeds
May your name be etched in legends.
Until the stars align once more
May the gods light your path
May the light of hope shine upon your path.
Farewell is bittersweet
Safe travels on your journey

It was a merry meeting.
We shall meet again some day.
May the stars shine upon your face
Go now with good hearts!
May you find what you seek
May we meet again
Farewell and return!
Farewell and sleep in peace
I drink to the fortunes of your house
Beyond the shadows we may meet again
Ride unto great renown!
Ride to good fortune!
What fun to be off again
Good-bye, until our next meeting!
Good-bye now! Take care of yourself!

May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks
