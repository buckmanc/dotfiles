Be just and true and only good will come to you
May the Peaceful One comfort you all the days of your life.
I wish goodness to envelop you this night.
Look to the stars for guidance.
Soar like an Eagle.
Look to the moons.
By the light of the night, all will be right.
May your aim be true.
Go in good health.
Keep your senses about you. 
May the tides favor your voyage.

May your wisdom be as powerful as your spells.
Use well your sorcery.
Let fate guide you.
The longest journey begins with a step.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
If you can't laugh with them, slug them.
It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you bend the rules
Go with the goddess embrace.
May the wind carry you safe
May your spear never dull
the hawk lords feathers cover you
May the gods smile upon us!
May your journey be more than its end.
Goodbye, and farewell.
May your god, whoever it may be, be with you.
May your days be long and nights be pleasant.
May your journey be straight and smooth.
I hope our paths cross again; until then, farewell.
May your shadow watch your back.
Journey well, and rest easy.
May your sword be quick in your hand, and your shield sturdy before you.
