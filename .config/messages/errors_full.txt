Please try again
Try harder next time
The force is not strong with this one
The cake is a lie
too bad
if at first you don't succeed...
practice makes perfect
good grief
oh well
whatever
whatevs
it could have been worse
there's a silver lining... somewhere
darn
eh
when life gives you lemons...
...try, try again
tfw things don't work out
well this is embarrassing
sigh
well then
ah, well
To be fair, it's all held together with shoestring and paperclips anyway.
Calamity and woe!
I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it
Needs to be at least 20% cooler
foolishness
Fool of a Took
Maybe if you just do the same thing again
Maybe you should take a break
it's probably your fault
it's not your fault
this is getting ridiculous
time for a nap
are you even trying?
I'm not sure you're trying
But don't give up now!
Aw, man!
It's not 1999 anymore
your parents would be proud
pretty sure that's a sin
it's never too late to change careers
where's the rubber duck when you need it?
have you considered religion?
thrice accursed machine
